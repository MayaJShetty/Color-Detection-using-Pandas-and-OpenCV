# Color-Detection-using-Pandas-and-OpenCV

Color Detection using Pandas and OpenCV is a project that aims to identify and
analyze specific colors in an image. By leveraging OpenCV's image processing
capabilities and utilizing Pandas for data manipulation, this project provides insights
into color distribution and helps in applications such as image segmentation, object
recognition, and visual analytics.
